There may be issues when trying to use flask within VScode so
you should operate within a virtual environment
1. Open a terminal 
2. python -m venv env
3. .\env\Scripts\activate
4. Once activated, you can install Flask and other required packages within this environment.
5. You'll have to go back into the virtual environment again after leaving VScode
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install fuzzywuzzy
pip install python-Levenshtein
pip install Flask
set FLASK_APP=movieRecommender.py
set FLASK_ENV=development
$env:FLASK_APP = "movieRecommender.py"
When you want to start up the server for testing 
flask run
